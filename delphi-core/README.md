## Running Tests
### Docker Environment Setup
1. Download Docker:
- Mac: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
- Windows: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows
2. In project root directory, run script:
```
./run_docker.sh
```
3. After the Dockerfile builds, you should see a new command line which is Debian (Jessie) with Node installed. All project files will automatically be copied over to the Docker container. All you need to do to test is:
```
truffle test
```

### Local Machine Environment Setup
1. Install Node JS 6.9.1 minimum: Either with install package or via package manager: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install truffle (currently 4.0.0-beta.2):
```
npm install -g truffle@^4.0.0-beta.2
```
3. Run the NPM package.json script:
```
npm install
```
4. Start truffle dev environment:
```
truffle develop
```
5. Run test in truffle dev command line:
```
test
```
6. (Optional) If you want to see the logs from the test, open a new terminal window and:
```
truffle develop --log
```
